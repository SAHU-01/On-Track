## Inspiration
The ongoing pandemic and the ensuing lockdown made us realize the human craving for live interaction and engagement. The rise of e-learning platforms and educational apps has acted as a beacon of light in response to the ongoing crisis. Youthful minds are not always organized minds. Students often struggle with managing notes and lesson materials. Hence, we present our website, On-Track.

## What it does
it provides all resourses and study materials for free,you can upload and see courses for free as well

## How we built it
With react and material ui,and using google meeet becuse we all lie on different parts of the globe

## Challenges we ran into
To make it a open source platform we had to work alot on backend and frontend

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we implemented a real-life problem and built it within two days. We all worked together on designing our Website on Figma, helped correct the flaws in each other's work. We made a open-source platform to help people with notes and courses.

## What we learned
While building On-Track, we learned cooperation, teamwork, and providing constructive criticism. We also learned how to solve a real-life problem in the present situation, and the complexity behind planning an appropriate website to meet people's needs.

## What's next for On-Track
Eneabling feature so that even job and intership opurtunities can be provided
